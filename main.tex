\section{web server log}
Information on user activity on the web server is located in the web server log file. Web server
logs are the primary source of data for user activity processing. It is called clickstream data.
Spiliopoulou et al.~\cite{Spiliopoulou2003} formally defined web server log. Let \textit{U} denote
all possible web requests on a web site. This set consists of all static pages and pages that can
be dynamicaly generated according to input parameters. The web server log \textit{L} is list of
page requests from the set \textit{U}. Records in the list \textit{L} are ordered by the timestamp
of the request.
